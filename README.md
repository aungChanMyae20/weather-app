## Credits

### OpenWeahter Map API

This application is using OpenWeather Map API for weather and forecast data.
In this project, I used the API key from OpenWeather Map API as an Environmental Variable in the `.env` file.

API calls are used for getting the weather and forecast data with geolocation(latitude, longitude) for default and city names.

### Varcel

The application is deployed on Vercel.
